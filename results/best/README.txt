# README for best behavior

# Controller type: Feedforward with P Control

# Controller Gains: 
KP: 5.5

# Notes
The robot initial configuration is offset from the first reference configuration. 
The initial configuration is:
phi = 0.5236
x = 0.1
y = 0.1
joint_1 = -pi/10
joint_2 = -pi/20
joint_3 = -pi/20
joint_4 = -pi/2
joint_5 = 0.0
This is to test the corrective behavior of the controller

There are some minor tracking error that could probably be resolved with a smaller dt for operation.
