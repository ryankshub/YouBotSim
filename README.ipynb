    "## Solution Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final project, we combined the work of milestone 2 with the new implemenations of milestone 1 and milestone 3 to have the YouBot complete a mobile manipulation objective. The main process of the software is as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate an end-effector trajectory of the objective being complete. \n",
    "2. Loop through the trajectory, for each iteration\n",
    "    i. Determine the current configuration using odometry of current configurations\n",
    "    ii. Use the psuedo-inverse Jacobian and Feedback Control to determine velocities\n",
    "    iii. Apply Euler's integration to produce new chassis, wheel, and joint configuration\n",
    "3. Compile data into logs and plot Xerr to judge controller performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are three Xerr plots from 'overshoot', 'best', and 'new_task' For the 'overshoot' and 'best' section, the robot performs the original task of moving the cube from (1, 0) to (0, -1) with a 90 degree clockwise change in its orientation. For 'new_task', the robot moves the cube from (.5, .5) to (.5, -.5) with the same 90 degree clockwise change. I chose this new_task because I wanted to see how screw trajectory planning would work for a path that's basically cartesian.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overshoot**\n",
    "![Overshoot](results/overshoot/YouBotErrorResp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the overshoot, we were trying to design a system too have an underdamped response, resulting it a oscillation before stabilizing. For this, we used a PI controller with feedforward equipped with **gains KP = 2 and KI = 4**. I chose a high KI because I wanted the roots to be complex conjugates in order to cause osciallations. I had to be careful not to pick a high KI, or the errors from integration would be too high. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best**\n",
    "![Best](results/best/YouBotErrorResp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the best, I decided to only use a **KP gain of 5.5** to drive the system to converge. There are some minor error from tracking the target, but the controller is able to complete the task. Rather than try to tune an integral gain for no overshoot, I think I would have prefered to alter the rate at which the controller processed (currently at dt=0.01) or add a derivative component instead to deal with the lagging response. \n",
    "\n",
    "**New_task**\n",
    "![NewTask](results/newTask/YouBotErrorResp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the new_task, I decided to use a **KP gain of 4**. Based on tuning for 'best' and 'overshoot', It seemed like a simple P-controller with feedforward could accomplish the goal. There are some tracking errors, but they are fairly small. In the future, I'd like to swap out Euler's Intergration with RK4 to limit simulation error and get a better picture of the scale of tracking errors. "
